Propose [num] hypotheses for [Character]'s observation of the world.
The observation refers to [Character]'s current perception of events or the world state. It is only considered clearly stated when [Character]'s perception is explicitly mentioned, like if [Character] see something or perceive something through other senses. Do not be speculative.
Do not provide any explanation for the hypotheses. Do not propose any sentence that's not depicting the observation, like action or belief of [Character].
The wording for hypotheses cannot be speculative.
If the information contains "not", make sure the verb for perception (e.g., "see", 'perceives') goes before "not" in the hypotheses. e.g., use 'sees that A is not in B' instead of 'does not see that A is in B'
Otherwise, do not include "not" in your hypotheses, and make sure the verb for perception goes first, e.g., 'sees that A is in B'.
