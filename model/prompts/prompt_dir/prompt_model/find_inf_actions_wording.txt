[Story]
Given the list of the actions of [Inferred_agent] that are clearly stated in the story without changing the original wording: [bare_actions]. 
If it is already in full sentences and grammatically correct do not change anything and output the same thing as the input. Do not change the names of any agent. 
If it is not in full sentences or not grammatically corrct, then follow the following steps. 
1. If [Inferred_agent] is not mentioned in the action then rephrase it so that it has [Inferred_agent]. 
2. Make sure that it is grammatically correct but do not lose any information.
3. If the object involved in [Inferred_agent]'s action is not clearly described and for example just described as "it" then write out explicitly what "it" is referring to. 
4. Do not guess anything and if you are not sure then do not change it. 
5. If nothing happens between two actions of [Inferred_agent] then treat them as one action.

The output format should be: ["aaa.", "bbb.", ...], ["aaa.", "bbb.", ...], and should be the same length as the list [bare_actions]. Output only this list.
