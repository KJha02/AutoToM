Extract the actions of [Inferred_agent] in the story verbatim without changing any of the original words, pluralizing the words, adding in [Inferred_agent] or any other name, replacing any of the words, replacing pronouns with names or replacing any names with pronouns. Actions of [Inferred_agent] are defined as events that will change the world state, e.g., [Inferred_agent] moving to a new location is an action but [Inferred_agent] being at a location is not an action. If [Inferred_agent] say something, the whole sentence (with 'replied', 'said') is seen as an action.

Do not change the names of any of the agents, if there is not a name and only a pronoun then just leave the pronoun. There can more than one agent or more than just the inferred agent. 
If there are multiple actions in a sentence then they should be extracted as one single action, without changing any of the original words, such as pluralizing the words, replacing any of the words, replacing pronouns with names or replacing any names with pronouns, and do not add any words.
Do not insert actions or pronouns or other words that are not explicitly stated in the text. Do not separate the objects in the same action.
Do not add any pronouns. Keep the commas, if any.
Only actions that have already occurred at the time can be considered clearly stated. Again, only extract actions performed by [Inferred_agent].
The output format should be: ["aaa.", "bbb.", ...]. Output only this list.
