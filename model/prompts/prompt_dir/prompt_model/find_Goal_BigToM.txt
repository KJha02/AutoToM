Determine if the goal of [Character] is clear in the story.
Summarize the most updated goal in the story, this means that it may not be the first sentence saying what [Character] wants but instead the most updated goal. Do not say "most updated goal" or anything not related to the story in the output. A goal is not just an action that [Character] takes and insetad is what [Character] wants to do or achieve.

Usually, goal refers to a person's goals or intentions regarding a particular event. Moreover, a sentence that shows a person has been trying to do something, or summarizes their efforts of doing something should always be considered a goal. Helping others to achieve their goals also counts as a person's goal.
Do not include any actions in your goal, if there are actions then remove it and only output the goal. 
Answer in the form of a list. The first element of the list contains the option A or B. A means clearly stated, and B means not clearly stated.
If the answer is A, include the goal, and place it in the second element of the list, without any kind of formatting. The sentence should follow the format of "[Character] wants ... " in the sentence.  

Otherwise the second element can be an empty string. Do not write anything else.
Example 1: ["A", "sentence of summarization of goal."]
Example 2: ["B", ""]
