If [Inferred_agent] say something, the whole sentence (with 'replied', 'said') is seen as an action.

In the context, there is an initial state of the object and an action that will change the state of it. 
Identify both the initial state and the final state of the object. 
If the action of [Inferred_agent] is done after the final state of the object then it counts as an action.

Do not change the names of any of the agents, if there is not a name and only a pronoun then just leave the pronoun. There can more than one agent or more than just the inferred agent. 
If the action is part of the sentence then extract the entire sentence , without changing any of the original words, such as pluralizing the words, replacing any of the words, replacing pronouns with names or replacing any names with pronouns, and do not add any words.
If there are multiple actions in a sentence then they should be extracted as one single action, without changing any of the original words, such as pluralizing the words, replacing any of the words, replacing pronouns with names or replacing any names with pronouns, and do not add any words.
Do not insert actions or pronouns or other words that are not explicitly stated in the text. Do not separate the objects in the same action.
Do not add any pronouns. Keep the commas, if any.
Only actions that have already occurred at the time can be considered clearly stated. Again, only extract actions performed by [Inferred_agent].
