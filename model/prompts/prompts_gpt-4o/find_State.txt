Determine if the story contains the objective state(s) of an object or an event.
State refers to the physical condition of something or the state of the world.
No actions of agents should be involved in the state but it can be the result of an action of an agent. For example, "A entered B" is not a state, while "A is in B" is a state.
An objective state statement should not include personal perspectives but should be objective. If a person's perception is involved, it is no longer considered an objective state.
Answer in the form of a list. The first element of the list contains the option A or B. A means clearly stated, and B means not clearly stated.
If the answer is A, include sentence(s) from the original story that serves as evidence, and place it in the second element of the list, without any kind of formatting. 
If there are multiple sentences, include them all in the second element of the list.
Otherwise the second element can be an empty string. Do not write anything else.
Example 1: ["A", "evidence sentence(s)."]
Example 2: ["B", ""]
