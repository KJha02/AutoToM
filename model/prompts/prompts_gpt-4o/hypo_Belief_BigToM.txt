First determine the observation of [Character] is explicitly mentioned in the given context, this will be in the rough format of [Character] observes ... or [Character] does not observe ... 
If the observation is explicitly mentioned, determine what the object the observation is about without including any information about the state or any adjectives. 

In the context, there is an initial state of the object and an action that will change the state of it. 
Identify both the initial state and the final state of the object. 
Based on both the initial and final state of the object, propose a hypothesis for each in the format of [Character] believes ... 
However, do not mention anything about the action that changes the state of the object, e.g. only describe the state or adjective of the object before and after. 

Output in this format: ["Belief About Initial State", "Belief About Final State"] for a list length of [num] so that only [num] hypotheses are proposed.
