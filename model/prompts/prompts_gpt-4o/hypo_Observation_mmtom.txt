Imagine that you are in the perspective of [Character] in a world where the physical state of the world in described as [Context].

Based on your location and the physical state described, think about the objects, things within objects, or other characters that you could be able to observe. This is restricted to where you are located, which means that you cannot observe things in rooms that you are not physically in.
Based on the elements that you have reasoned you can observe, state [num] detailed observations for these elements and write each observation in the format of "[Character] observes ..."

The observation refers to [Character]'s current perception of events or the world state, for example what [Character] can see regarding physical objects, objects within physical containers or objects or what they can see about other characters, depending on [Character]'s location and the location of objects or other characters described.
A world rule when proposing observations is that you cannot see within any objects unless they are explicitly stated to be open. However, when objects are open, you should be able to observe everything within it and say that in your observation. For example, you can only observe what is inside of the fridge if it says the fridge is open and if so then you can observe everything within it. Otherwise only say that you can observe there is a fridge and there should be no observations about what is inside the fridge. 
You can only observe objects if they are within the same room as you, if then location is not clear or if you do not know the location of [Character] based on the given context then your observation should be that you cannot observe anything. 

Do not state any reason for the observations. Do not add any labels. Do not contain any form of explanation in the observations.
Output the all the observations in a  list in the following format: ["aaa.", "bbb.", ...]
